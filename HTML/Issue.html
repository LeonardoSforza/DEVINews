              <p>
                This just in, the DEVI school Group A quarantine is almost over! October 1st is the official date. The staff
                and
                students are anxiously waiting to be able to finally do various things that had to be held off from during
                the
                quarantine. A few things include: walking alongside the river from the hostel to the school building and
                experiencing
                the changing season in nature, visiting Liverpool and enjoying a quick trip to Tim Hortons, and soon, the
                students will
                be able to participate in various local activities like tennis, volleyball, swimming and much more.
                <br><br>
    
                The students are now in their third week of school with more students arriving each week. Updates on the
                current status
                of the incoming students are as unpredictable as the weather in Nova Scotia. On Wednesday the 23rd of
                September, our
                area was lightly hit by Storm Teddy, with strong winds and plenty of rain, but on the following Thursday and
                Friday, the
                temperature reached a high of a whopping 20 degrees celsius. The rain brought by the storm, however, was
                much needed to
                fill the wells of the Girls House at the DEVI School. We can shower now!
                <br><br>
    
                This year, the DEVI school is introducing a new uniform as well as incorporating a variety of clubs for
                students to join
                and enjoy. We are currently in a transition phase to the new uniform, but we’re sure that once all the
                students are
                accustomed to it, our student body will look brighter than ever. As for the clubs, the goal is for each
                student to find
                a passion and follow through with it. The various clubs include a selection of sports like football,
                possibly archery,
                running, biking, and more. Other more academic clubs include tutoring for English and Math, Book + Film
                Club, a student
                council, drawing, and other arts pursuits. In addition, there will be a baking club, community service,
                qawwali/bhajan
                group, and various forms of dance. With these commitments, students will hopefully enjoy spending their time
                focusing on
                their hobbies and interests.
                <br><br>
    
                For the first time in the DEVI School’s fourth year, we held a few house competitions. If you don’t already
                know, each
                student and member of staff is part of one of the three different houses at our school. The houses are SAT
                (meaning
                truth), CHIT (attention), and ANAND (joy). Each can not exist without one another, but when it comes to
                competition, the
                houses go head and head. This week, each house chose and presented a challenge for the others to compete in.
                SAT chose a
                match of foosball, CHIT chose for each house to create an acapella song from scratch, and ANAND chose a
                round of
                volleyball. The prize will be chocolate cake for the whole house! With this winner's pot, the competition is
                going to be
                intense. The next issue will announce the winner of the competitions, so don’t miss it. The DEVI School
                sends love to
                all the students and staff who will be arriving soon.

              <p>
                Beep! Beep! Beep! The alarm rings next to my ear at 5:20 am, waking me up mid-dream. I rummage around in the
                darkness
                and snooze it before the noise gets louder and more annoying. I lay in bed for another minute, trying to
                remember my
                dream but it's too late, another thought has already filled my mind. The time has come.
                <br><br>
    
                One hour later I'm sitting in the school’s blue van with my classmates. Sir Andrew in the driver's seat and,
                my mom,
                Miss Grit as the co-pilot. Shri Mataji's voice fills the van as we meditate in silence, still waiting for
                the sun to
                rise. The drive goes on for about 2 hours, then it's breakfast time. We drive down a small side road and
                stop next to
                what seems to be a small private property. The sea is right in front of us, we don't hesitate and walk
                across the lawn
                down to the rocky beach, each of us carrying a bowl of porridge that Uncle Chaitanya has lovingly made for
                us. We enjoy
                our food looking at the sparkling water as the sun rises behind us. It's a good start for our trip, and we
                are all very
                excited for what is to come.
                <br><br>
    
                The next part of the road trip is smooth, we take a break at a little picnic spot next to a lake and get
                some fresh air,
                making sure to enjoy the nature before continuing on our journey. Our destination is Brier Island, to get
                there we have
                to take two ferries, one that will take us onto Long Island and then another one that will drop us off at
                our
                destination. Afterward another hour and a half of driving would take us to our accommodation. We all exit
                the van
                excited and walk into the little farm where we are going to stay overnight. It's a beautiful place, chickens
                running
                around freely, cats, sheep, alpacas and dogs, all living in harmony. After Victoria, our host, shows us
                around this
                magical place, indicating where we are going to sleep in her amazing, cozy little house, we eat a delicious
                lunch. After
                our meal we make our way towards the dock where we will get on our boat, which will hopefully take us to see
                the whales!
                That is where the real fun starts.
                <br><br>
    
                The boat trip starts off well, we are all excited and on the lookout for signs of whales. This means we had
                our eyes
                open to catch any sign of their tails, backs and sprays from their blowholes. More than an hour pases and we
                don’t spot
                anything, our general mood is going down. We decided to give a few bhandans as our boat turned its course
                back towards
                the mainland. Then it happens, as I'm staring into the distance I see a plume of water erupting a few
                hundred meters
                away from us. I keep looking incase I spot something else, and it happens! Once again, I see the spurt of
                vapour as a
                whale breaks the surface of the deep blue sea. I'm not the only one who has seen this and as I turn to tell
                one of the
                crewmembers what I just witnessed another passenger has already alerted them. In fact they already knew
                this, they had
                received a radio call that whales had been sited close to the coast. We slowly make our way towards the
                group of whales
                and once we are closer we are able to observe that there are three of them. Three adult Humpback Whales. We
                stare at the
                immense creatures as they emerge in order to get air, each of these mammals weighing around 30 tonnes with a
                length
                between 13 and 16 meters. In turns the passengers get to climb onto a higher part of the boat to get better
                views. Each
                time the whales rise to the surface to breathe, we admire their beauty and majesty for a few minutes. Being
                so close to
                these huge creatures is so amazing and makes us admire the power of the creation of god. Then they dive down
                again,
                occasionally throwing up their tails and staying underwater for around five minutes. We follow the group of
                whales for
                another hour and a half then it's time to return to mainland.
                <br><br>
    
                Once we are back, we decide to go to the far side of the island to meditate and watch the sunset. It is a
                beautiful
                evening and we have a great meditation next to the lighthouse. For dinner we cook pasta and fry some tofu.
                We
                collectively cooked a delicious meal and enjoyed it with our family. Then the most unexpected thing happens,
                after we
                all finished eating, our host Victoria suddenly brings in a birthday cake. I start singing until I realize
                that everyone
                is singing for me, it's a late celebration for my 18th birthday. It is the best cake I've had in a long
                time. I’m so
                happy and I feel so much love from all my brothers and sister. The night of our first day ends with us
                watching a movie
                together. Then I go to bed next to my bros and fall asleep instantly.
                <br><br>
    
                The next day starts off great. We wake up to the smell of freshly made pancakes. The breakfast is amazing
                and we all
                stuff ourselves until we can no longer eat. Today we're going back home to the school but the trip is not
                over yet, on
                our way we're planning to stop in several places. Our first stop is at the Brier Island Seal Cove. After a
                10 minute
                walk we got there. It was amazing. Around 20 seals were swimming in the water and chilling on the rocks,
                staring at us
                with their big curious eyes. The water was super clear and looked really good so Leonardo, Isa and I decided
                to swim. To
                put it plainly, it was freezing, but that didn't matter. I wanted to get as close as possible to the seals
                so I swam
                towards them. It was an amazing experience, despite them slowly disappearing underwater as I approached.
                After our first
                stop we all had lunch and then our trip continued. We had a little nap in the van until we reached the
                Balancing Rock.
                We followed a beautiful, small trail that led all the way out to the ocean and there it was, the famous
                Balancing Rock.
                We admired the rock for some time, took pictures and tried to push it down, no chance though for the whole
                thing weighed
                about 18 tonnes. Then it was time to go back home. For real. The last stretch of the trip went silent, we
                stopped once
                more to watch the pink and orange sunset sky and then we were back. That night we all went to bed with our
                hearts full
                of joy from this wonderful experience.
                <br><br>
    
                Beep! Beep! Beep! Once again, the alarm rings next to my ear at 8:45 am, waking me up mid-dream. I lay in
                bed
                remembering the past two days. It wasn't a dream, it was real.

                The desperate members of the DEVI School finally got to walk to school for the first time in the DEVI
                School’s fourth
                year.
    
                <br><br>
    
                On the 1st of October 2020 the students' and staff's quarantine came to an end. The quarantine lasted for 4
                weeks. As
                the chaisted day came closer the students couldn’t wait any longer. “Why do we have to walk everyday? I want
                to get a
                drive”, was the most common phrase heard in the mornings at the dormitories over past years. However, once
                walking
                was forbidden most students couldn't stand not moving their feet (pun intended). Over the past four weeks
                the drivers
                among the DEVI School staff had to drive the students to school everyday. The students lazily sat in the
                car, hoping all
                this would be over. From van windows, they studied how the leaves on the trees turned colorful but they
                couldn't yet
                enjoy the fresh air and beautiful sights as they did once before. Nevertheless, time flew by and now they
                can go outside
                and enjoy every moment. Luckily we won't be hearing the complaints for a long time.
    
                <br><br>
    
                Soon enough, the principal planned many exciting outings. The first outing took place on the 4th of October.
                They were
                taken to a place, where they had a long walk down to the ocean. A few days later during a school day they
                went across
                Nova Scotia to a farm where fruits were grown, ready to be picked. On the same day they were surprised with
                another trip
                to the biggest (and probably only) zoo in Nova Scotia. It was a new adventure for the DEVI School members
                and the day
                was filled with joy and many new memories were made. Those feelings of happiness now continue in the DEVI
                School, as
                with everyday, new adventures await.

              <br><br>
              <p>
                Directed by Karey Kirkpatrick, Imagine that is a typical family movie, with Eddie Murphy starring as Evan
                Danielson, a
                busy financial advisor and a disregarding father towards his daughter Olivia. The main star of the movie is
                Olivia’s
                magic blanket that acts as a bridge to improving Evan’s relationship with his daughter. It does so by
                providing a
                glimpse into Olivia’s imaginary world that simultaneously gives him hints on the future of the financial
                world, leading
                him to success at work. Throughout the course of the movie Eddie Murphy’s comedic touch scarcely shines
                through while
                Yara Shahidi’s portrayal of Olivia successfully manages to carry out the feelings of a neglected daughter.
                In conclusion
                this movie is enjoyable yet it could have done a better attempt at showcasing more intensely the
                inner-workings of a
                broken relationship rather than just scraping the surface of it.

            Under the bed was a box of spinning tops.
            <br>
            Spinning away into forgotten dreams.

                  The new exciting Korean thriller which unfolds itself in layers with darkness at its core about the
                  social classes.
                  Opens a new light to the genre of Korean thrillers. The story is about a well-planned scheme that leads
                  to a disastrous
                  clash between members of different families. A lower-class family pulls a scheme to become employed by a
                  wealthy family,
                  by infiltrating their household and passing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals. Bong’s work is
                  playful and
                  intriguing, and will also make you sit on the edge of your chair. His return with a twisting
                  comedy-thriller, perfect
                  cast and filmmaking was a good, entertaining surprise to most viewers. Realistically the poor stay poor
                  and the rich
                  stay rich, is the deeper picture that Bong tried to emphasize in this black comedy. The divide between
                  rich and poor in
                  the movie, offers some view on modern life and society in general. Not surprisingly parasite was the
                  first non-English
                  movie to win the Oscars in 2019 and grossed $264 million. There are many clever moments throughout but
                  the themes and
                  commentary are the movie’s strongest takeaway. It’s a gripping movie from start to finish. “You'll be
                  thinking about
                  this movie for weeks”, says Micheal Owen, I must admit he isn't wrong.

            <p>
              The German battleship, Bismarck set sail on the 19 th of May 1941 out into open waters. The Bismarck
              weighed over 50,000 tons and had 64 guns and was a replacement for SMS Hannover and was 251 m
              long. With a crew of 2200 enlisted men and 103 officers, it could carry 4 planes for scouting. Its
              mission was to head for the Atlantic where it would destroy and cripple English supplies. After
              leaving port, the Bismarck headed for the Danish straits to meet with the German ship Prinz Eugen
              and her 3-destroyer escort.
              <br><br>
              Shortly after they met up, they encountered Swedish cruiser Gauntlet who unbeknownst to the
              Germans, radioed a report back to navel HQ which was passed on to the British navy with
              condolences to England. As soon as they received the information a pair of planes were sent to
              locate the enemy fleet. On the Bismarck their mission was so secret that the crew did not know until
              20 th of May when they were told over loudspeaker. Meanwhile, Swedish ship Gauntlet shadowed the
              Bismarck for 2 hours as it travelled along the Swedish coast. The German fleet reached the
              Norwegian coast and stopped to restock on supplies. The British found out and sent a small group of
              fighters to reconnoitre. While this was happening the Germans also sent spy planes to scout the
              British naval base in Scapa Flow.
              <br><br>
              Britain sent HMS battleship Hood and HMS battleship Prince of Wales plus 6 destroyers to reinforce
              a lone pair of cruisers that were the only force protecting the Denmark strait. They also sent 18
              bombers to destroy the anchored ships but as luck would have it, a storm whipped up making the
              bombers unable to locate their target. The next day the Bismarck and escort left port to continue
              their mission. Later, the 3 destroyers accompanying the Bismarck and Prinz Eugen broke off allowing
              the two ships to continue alone. Soon both the Bismarck and Prinz Eugen sped up to 27 knots to
              break through the Danish straits.
              <br><br>
              A few days later the Bismarck spotted the HMS Hood and HMS Prince of Wales who attacked both
              enemy ships. Only just 8 minutes into the fighting, the HMS Hood was destroyed and the Prince of
              Wales, severely damaged. Shortly after the conflict the Bismarck was discovered to have been
              damaged more harshly than first thought and it needed to set sail back to occupied France for repair
              leaving the Prinz Eugen to continue the mission alone. Later that day, a British plane spotted the oil
              trail left by the Bismarck and reported it immediately to the British navy who scrambled all available
              British ships at the chance of destroying Germany's best ship. Six battleships and battlecruisers, two
              aircraft carriers, thirteen cruisers and twenty-one destroyers all began the hunt for the Bismarck.
              <br><br>
              The Bismarck was traveling at 28 knots which was the same speed of the pursuing ships. If the
              Bismarck could reach the cover of the Luftwaffe, any attempt to sink her would be suicidal. The
              British sent a night raid of 6 fighters and 9 torpedo bombers, but they almost attacked the ship
              Norfolk which gave away their position to the Bismarck. None of the aircrafts were hit but only 9
              torpedoes hit the Bismarck which caused only superficial damage but also opened the wound made
              earlier by the Prince of Wales. The Bismarck was slowed to a speed of 16 knots but was repaired by
              the next day which allowed it to speed again at 28 knots.
              <br><br>
              Entering waters that were known for patrolling U-boats, the British were forced to zig-zag to avoid
              the threat. The Bismarck shakes off British ships, but the Bismarck did not know that and so sent a
              message to Paris asking for air support. The British decoded the message and triangulated the
              location of the Bismarck, but a mistake put them on the wrong course for seven hours. The Bismarck
              would be in range of air cover in around a day and the nearest ship was a small aircraft carrier which
              was only equipped with swordfish biplanes. So, in a desperate attempt, the British launched 15
              planes into the air, but the pilots were never told of their target and accidentally attacked Sheffield
              but luckily the torpedoes missed.
              <br><br>
  
              The planes were re-armed with contact detonator torpedoes and took off again eventually locating
              the Bismarck and opening fire. Most of the torpedoes miss but two hit her, one causing superficial
              damage and the other hitting her rudder which locks in a 12-degree turn making the Bismarck turn
              in a large circle. The captain, seeing that all was lost sent a message that simply read,
              <br>
            </p>
            <p class="indent"><i>“Ship unmaneuverable. We will fight to the last shell. Long live the Fuhrer.”</i></p>
            <p>
              The British closed in and by the end of the day they shot over 2800 shells and the Bismarck still had
              not been sunk. The British ships running low on fuel set back to port while the cruiser Dorsirture was
              ordered to destroy the Bismarck with its torpedoes and the Bismarck was hit: 2 on her starboard
              side and two on her port side. The mighty Bismarck slipped beneath the waves.
              <br><br>
              Of a crew of over 2200 men, only 114 would survive.

            <p class="text-center"><i>Kabir Yunjian Feng 30/10/2020</i></p>
            <p>
              The ancient Mongolian Empire was the second-largest empire in history, lasting from 1206 to 1368 AC,
              covering the most
              contiguous territory. Their military force was so strong and unstoppable that fear and terror spread
              wherever they went.
              We can even say that Genghis Khan, the leader of the empire, was the greatest commander ever. But how were
              they so
              strong? Actually, if we learn from their secrets, we can be as powerful as these warriors, not necessarily
              on the
              battlefield, but when studying.
              <br><br>
              Training is important for an army and for us. Following their traditions, Mongolian children started
              practicing athletic
              skills at a very young age. They had a tough but reasonable training which involved using all kinds of
              weapons. Each
              warrior possessed great ability in many aspects. At school, we need this for every subject, especially for
              mathematics.
              Completing massive exercises not only refreshes the knowledge you achieved but also improves your speed and
              accuracy so
              that you commit fewer mistakes, similarly to how Mongolians practiced precise arrow shooting while riding on
              horses.
              They mastered the use of spears, lances, axes, and composite bows, while we became proficient in
              trigonometry, algebra,
              calculus, and so on. It’s important to establish the basics so that all matters would become handy, which
              means we
              should revise more often. It’s also important to be confident, feeling as if you were rushing like a storm
              in the field,
              reaping and destroying all the enemies.
              <br><br>
              From ancient Mongolians, we can also learn how to evoke our interests. Yes, the Mongolians did enjoy
              battling,
              conquering, and killing, and they always had an unfulfilled desire for global conquest. We should be
              peaceful people,
              but what can we learn from them to enjoy studying? Whenever someone reminds us of our homework, we might
              just say, ‘Oh,
              I’ll do it tomorrow’. It’s because we are afraid and tired of the feeling which is related to studying, and
              it’s really
              a big obstacle. There is a poem from the Qin Dynasty in ancient China that exactly shows this kind of
              situation:
              <br><br>
              <i>"Song of tomorrow"</i>
              <br>
              <i>
                Qian Hetan<br><br>
                Tomorrow, again, tomorrow<br>
                Tomorrow’s. There are so many tomorrows!<br>
                My life is waiting for tomorrow<br>
                All times become wasted<br>
                <br><br>
                People in the world are implicated by tomorrows<br>

                Morning (I) saw water flowing to the east<br>
                During the sunset, (I) saw the sun falling down to the west<br>
                What can (we) do with a hundred years’ tomorrow?<br>
                (I) invite you to listen to my song of tomorrow<br>
  
              </i>
              <br><br>
              What did the Mongolians do? Firstly, the leaders promoted soldiers based on their merit, rather than their
              backgrounds.
              Secondly, all the wealth they gained from the war would be shared equally. Thirdly, prizes and rewards would
              be given to
              worthy ones. In this way, they tried their best at war and became addicted to invading. Of course, we should
              never fight
              with each other, but now we see why Mongolians succeeded in doing so. We should try to relate more positive
              things to
              the concept of studying. When we are enjoying ourselves, we are more excited, and we would be more
              dedicated. It’s a
              virtuous circle. The achievements, or accomplishments of hard work, which are especially reflected through
              exams, would
              also be satisfying and entertaining. In psychology, there is a term called ‘flow’, when a person is fully
              immersed in a
              feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoys the process of the activity. When the small paths
              of flow join,
              we would have a continuous river of joy, and studying would be never the same.
              <br><br>
              Another feature of the Mongolians is that they quickly adapted everything to their lifestyle. They adapted
              to the
              climate changes in the steppes; they adapted to different landscapes; they adapted new technologies by
              learning from the
              prisoners of war, for example, they forced Chinese prisoners to teach them medical skills, gunpowder usage,
              and more, to
              invade Beijing; and they adapted local traditional cultures when they conquered. We should adapt to absorb
              knowledge
              more efficiently from the classes we attend. It’s easy to do too much or too little, but it’s hard to do the
              right
              amount. We should fit and incorporate our beats and paces with the rhythm of school life, to keep them
              natural and in
              balance.
              <br><br>
              The Mongolian warriors were cruel, but their ways to achieve something might be useful when applied in
              studying. Genghis
              Khan might have been wrong, but he could teach us how to be great masters of ourselves. Staying engaged,
              keeping the
              balance, and establishing our basics will make us unstoppable when studying.

            <p class="text-center"><i>Anonymous student 30/10/2020</i></p>
            <p>
              The sky is blue.
  
              <br><br>
              Such a simple sentence, maybe one of the simplest in the English language after “I am”, “I eat” and “I
              sleep”. A simple
              sequence of four words: an article, a noun, a verb, and an adjective. The longest of these words contains
              four letters
              and is known and extensively used by anyone who commonly speaks the English language. In practical terms,
              this regards
              most of the global population. Then, if you have the chance, go to a window and look at the sky, observe it
              with this
              sentence in your mind, “the sky is blue.” I do not know if any of you, while making this observation, had
              any thoughts
              about the sky or wished to question the reasoning behind it.
  
              <br><br>
              However, in my case, I was walking back from school, and, like any student who just finished another day of
              school and
              studying, my head was a constant explosion of thoughts, worries, and processes. As soon as I turned my head
              upwards,
              chaos became nothing.
  
              <br><br>
              At first, nothing.
              Then, I saw only beauty.
  
              <br><br>
              The sky was blue.
  
              <br><br>
              A few words would pop into my mind to describe what lay before me. Daylight, light, just blue, all words
              that sound so
              obvious, to the extent that it seems like they add nothing to this concept. When I asked others what were
              the first
              words they thought of when they were simply told “the sky is blue”. Similar words, thoughts, and emotions
              were the
              results of this small research.
  
              <br><br>
              Simply put, I was unsatisfied with the results I acquired, and maybe I should have been, it’s the Divine’s
              work after
              all.
  
              <br><br>
              Notwithstanding this thought, I went further, asking myself several questions, some of which I was able to
              answer,
              others, not quite.
  
              <br><br>
              “Why is the sky blue?”
              <br><br>
              “What is the limit of the sky?”
              <br><br>
              “Does the sky have a limit, and if it does, where and what is it?”
              <br><br>
              “Why blue?”
              <br><br>
              Now, these had more to do with the science of Electromagnetism, Optics, and Astronomy. But, once I started
              answering
              them, more and more questions and answers would fill my brain, until they faded into the deep blue overhead.
              <br><br>
              Hopefully, this sparks your interest, and, be that the case, make sure to come back for article 2 of “The
              Sky is Blue”.

            <p>
              Let’s go back four years. It was about that time that I heard from my mother that some yogis from all over
              the world
              wanted to start a Sahaj school, with grades 6-12. From the start, I didn’t really care about all of it.
              Then, little by little, I
              got to know more news about the progress of this idea. One evening my parents told me that the yogis found a
              big
              building for only $1 CAD in Nova Scotia, Canada. I was really confused: how could a big building be sold
              only for a
              dollar? I was told that the condition was that its buyer should make a school out of it, which was a perfect
              match for
              the yogis starting the school. After some time, the school began its first year. At that time, my parents
              put me and my
              elder brothers on the waiting list. We got accepted in the summer after the 2nd year.
              <br><br>
              As soon as we got the acceptance, we started doing all of the homework, packing our suitcases, applying for
              the study
              permit, buying the clothes that we needed and other supplies. It was a very big headache that summer;
              everything was
              ready except the study permits, so all of us were very worried. Luckily, we got the study permit 4 days
              before the
              flight and flew successfully. Then followed the interesting part.
              <br><br>
              When I came to the DEVI School my life changed radically. I became more responsible, my English improved, I
              got to know
              many different cultures and made friends from all over the world. It was a complete change of my life coming
              to the DEVI
              School. I got so much love, friends, good teachers and enjoyed my everyday. DEVI School is really the school
              of the
              Devi. Sincerely, I cannot imagine my life without it. With love to all the staff and students of the DEVI
              School
              2019-2020.

            <p class="text-center"><i>Lalita Arslan 31/10/2020</i></p>
            <p>
              The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank is somewhat of an autobiography but it is unique for several
              reasons. The first
              being that it was not written to be published. A young girl had simply kept a diary through tough times with
              no idea
              that her story would be shared around the world. Most autobiographies are written with the purpose of giving
              the reader
              an inside scoop of an influencer’s life. Anne, however, did not know how inspiring her story was. Another
              reason why it
              differs from most stories is its structure. Anne Frank guides the reader through her life during the
              holocaust through
              her diary. The reader goes on a journey of what life was like in the Netherlands from 1942-1944 from Anne’s
              eyes.
              <br><br>
              “If a novelist were to attempt to invent an authentic young narrator, situation, and story arc, that writer
              could do no
              better than the teen Anne Frank did with her diary”, says Common Sense Media’s book reviewer Barbara
              Schultz. Somehow,
              Anne, having written her diary for no specific audience, removes any filter that may have affected how she
              told her
              story. Not only because it was a true story, but because it was an exclusive story. By naming it “Kitty”,
              Anne had
              befriended her diary and wrote in it as if speaking to her best friend about all her worries, troubles and
              concerns.
              It’s the perfect inside scoop.
              <br><br>
              Anne’s diary began when she was gifted with a journal on her 13th birthday on June 12th. Her life was not
              yet affected
              by World War II, but actually began with her living a common 12 year old Jewish girl’s life in Germany in
              1942. It
              wasn’t until July 6, 1942, that the Franks had to turn their whole life upside down because of the war. The
              family was
              forced to leave their home in Germany after Anne’s older sister, Margot, was ordered to report to a work
              camp. After
              leaving a trace of a fake escape to Switzerland, Otto Frank led his family to the Netherlands, where they
              hid in the
              Secret Annexe. When documenting what it was like to leave her whole life behind, Anne said "Though this did
              hurt me
              deeply, I realized that Germany was not the world, and I left my country forever."
              <br><br>
              In the Netherlands, the Franks hid in the Attic of one of Otto Frank’s warehouse buildings. They called the
              attic the
              Secret Annexe. The importance of this title is fully understood when Anne explains its significance several
              times in her
              diary. It was a small, concealed room in which she and her family, as well as an older Jewish couple, named
              the Van
              Daans, called home for 761 days. The Annexe was covered by a moving bookcase that succeeded in hiding the
              Jews in Miep
              and Jan Gies’ house until August 4, 1944. Until then, Anne went through times of trouble with a lack of
              sufficient food,
              books for her to maintain and continue her education, entertainment and, most times, joy. Before fleeing
              Germany, Anne
              attended the Montessori School but was later transferred to a Jewish School with her friend Lies. At school,
              Anne was
              sought after by many boys, and she very clearly enjoyed it and longed for it when she had to go into hiding,
              but then,
              she met Peter Van Daan. For months, she had no interest in him whatsoever, but toward the end of her open
              ended stay,
              she fell in love with the Jewish boy she was in hiding with. Her love for him helped her push through the
              dull or scary
              days that would pass because at the end of every day, she knew when she went up the stairs to his quarters,
              he was there
              for her to talk to as if there was no war around them.
              <br><br>
              Anne had her 15th birthday in the Secret Annexe in 1944 and she explained that, “I know my various faults
              and
              shortcomings better than anyone else, but there's one difference: I also know that I want to change, will
              change and
              already have changed greatly!” For just being 15 years young, Anne was more mature and aware of the world
              than a typical
              adult. Anne had lived decades worth of agony and sorrow in her 15 years of life. Sadly, it wasn’t long after
              her
              birthday that the Franks were found. Anne’s diary ends on Tuesday, August 1, 1944 with the final phrase “If
              only there
              were no other people in the world.” When writing this, Anne did not know that in 3 days, her family would be
              taken back
              to Germany to work in concentration camps. On August 4, the Franks were pulled away from each other. The
              first to be
              separated was the father, Otto and later, their mother. With no evidence of an exact date, Anne and her
              sister Margot
              were saved from the gas chambers and were sent to a camp called Bergen Belsen in Northern Germany where Anne
              found her
              old friend Lies. At the camp, Anne and Margot were separated, and not long after, Margot died. In February
              of 1945, as
              if having felt her sister’s passing, Anne died as well, peacefully. She had not yet turned 16.
              <br><br>
              The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank displays a touching and moving story of a powerful girl who left a
              mark on the
              world simply with her diary entries. No story can compare to Anne’s, whose life was an unimaginable struggle
              that she
              pushed through with little help from the world.

            <p>
              Apple is and has been a great tech company over the years, releasing phones, PCs and
              many other devices. This part of the article will explore the benefits of Apple phones and if
              they are in fact better than Android. Many people throughout the years have said the
              quality of Apple is far better than Android. Which is true in some cases, but not in all.
              <br><br>
              Android is a mobile operating system operative in almost all non-Apple products. All the
              other phone companies mainly use Android operating systems due to their opinions of it
              being better. Many of these companies make very good phones like Xiaomi, Huawei and so
              on. Some phone companies have been competing since the very start, for example,
              Samsung. The battle officially began in June 2007 and since then the battle between Apple
              and Android has not stopped.
              <br><br></p>
            <h4 class="sub-title-modal">What Apple does Better:</h4><br>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Apple put better chips in phones which supposedly makes them faster.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Their whole system is more integrated due to the fact that Apple makes most of the
                  parts within the phone.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>It is easier to use, with the system Apple phones come with (iOS) people won&#39;t have
                  any trouble using the phones due to the fact that everything is much more simple
                  and straightforward.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Many apps only downloadable on the Apple devices (that Apple created) are, in
                  people’s opinions, far better than most of the apps that are not (for example, people
                  say that Apple Music is better than Spotify).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The phones are very artistic and lots of people buy them for aesthetic purposes.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Apple Pay makes buying things in a store much easier.</p>
              </li>
            </ul><br>
  
            <h4 class="sub-title-modal">What Android does better:</h4><br>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Android is cheaper than Apple.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Android includes headphone jacks, unlike Apple where you need to buy Dongles.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Its charger is normally compatible with a lot of other non-Apple devices such as JBL
                  speakers, headphones and so on.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>An Android phone can be customised to such an extent that you can make your
                  phone exactly how you want it.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Android a better file system.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The back button is a great feature and Apple does not have this button; one can visit
                  previous pages and exit an app very easily.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The multi-window feature is very useful, it enables you to use four apps at the same
                  time.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>There are far more apps on Android markets than on the Apple app store.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>There are more choices for login settings, for example, drawing a pattern, writing a
                  Code, and scanning your face, and fingerprint for entry to your phone.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>There are high-speed, cheap Android phones, for example Xiaomi phones.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>They have a better battery life.</p>
              </li>
            </ul><br>
  
            <p>
              It is fact, I assure you, and by no means my unprecedented bias against Apple that compels
              me to conclude that Apple phones are made for those who are more artistic, and for
              people who prefer an easier system. Indeed, people who like spending and have a modest
              amount of money usually like to buy Apple products. People who prefer to have total
              freedom with their phones, who know what Android can do and who have an average
              understanding of the system are more likely to buy an Android phone. Again, all based on
              the facts above. Dear readers, if you need a decent phone and have a low budget, buy an
              Android.

              As we delve further into the school year and get more serious about our studies, both students and staff are
              reaching
              out with many new ideas. A recent suggestion was the initiative of school clubs for students and staff to
              gather and
              have a good time doing different activities.
              <br><br>
              Additionally, this turns out to be useful for the newly graduating students who can mention them in their
              applications
              for further studies. There are many clubs already starting to happen and many still in the books waiting to
              happen.
              Sports like swimming, basketball, running and skateboarding have already begun thanks to these clubs. Places
              like the
              Emera Centre and the skatepark, in Liverpool, helped for these activities to occur.
              <br><br>
              Another great idea that recently took place was a competition between the houses Sat, Chit and Anand, which
              was
              suggested by our school’s principal, Miss Mary. On the beautiful, sunny afternoon of Saturday, September
              26th, every
              house chose a specific competition for either the other two houses or for all the houses to participate in.
              With a
              volleyball tournament from Anand House, a fooßball tournament from Sat House and a non-instrumental music
              competition
              from Chit House, it turned out to be a great weekend.
              <br><br>
              Perhaps one of the most exciting ideas yet was the creation of the DEVI School Instagram page. Many students
              are very
              enthusiastic about setting up an Instagram page where they would be able to share their ideas and would
              promote the
              school, allowing new students to have a better understanding of the school life, as well as letting parents
              know what
              all the kids are up to. There are many staff and students who are contributing to make the Instagram page a
              success as
              soon as possible. With the photography interests of many DEVI School students, this project would also be a
              very joyful
              experience.
  
              <br><br>
              We are working hard to bring out the best possible ideas and projects for the parents, staff and students to
              enjoy and
              we hope all of you readers are as excited as we are! We have just started with the Instagram page and we
              will surely see
              some progress over the next few weeks. Be sure to follow us: @DEVI_News_Official.

            <p class="text-center"><i>Leonardo Sforza 2/10/2020</i></p>
            <p>
              Today, 1st October 2020, group A is finally out of quarantine. The groups are made depending on the dates of
              arrival at
              the school. For example, some staff members stayed in Mill Village over summer and therefore did not have to
              quarantine.
              The first person to come to Mill Village was Isa, a grade 12 student, on the 28th of August. When he arrived
              at the DEVI
              School group A officially started. The already present staff would quarantine with Isa and the incoming
              students and
              staff members. The last person to come on the 16th of September was Uncle Igor, officially being the last
              member of
              quarantine group A as the 2-week countdown began. Notwithstanding the fact that for some people quarantine
              lasted more
              than 2 weeks, I will tell you how quarantine was from September 16th to September 30th.
  
  
              <br><br>
              Life was honestly very chill. We would meditate at 7:30 am after being woken up by a staff member 20-15
              minutes before
              meditation, however I would wake up at 7:29, brush my teeth, change my clothes and be seated in the
              meditation room by
              7:30. The only person that had to wake up earlier and be in the meditation room before 7:30 would be the
              leader of the
              meditation. He or she was in charge of cleaning Shri Mataji’s photograph with rose water and doing the Aarti
              with some
              incense.
  
              <br><br>
              Meditation would go from 7:30 to 8:00 and after we enjoyed breakfast. We would go to the main house, aka the
              hostel,
              wash our hands and line up for breakfast. The one thing you will get from every Sahaj School is detachment
              from food,
              but unfortunately, at the DEVI School, that is not always the case. The food is not better than home food
              (what can I
              say, I’m Italian), but the cooks at the DEVI School always have a killer dish that would make you forget
              yesterday’s
              porridge. Either way, DEVI School students always get the required nutrients for them to carry out a healthy
              life.
  
              <br><br>
              School would start at 8:50am. We would get driven to school because we were still in quarantine and could
              not walk to
              school. The drive would take 2 minutes and the distance from the Hostel to the school building is 1.3 km.
              From 8:50 to
              9:00 students would have a homeroom period in which every grade stayed in a preassigned classroom and
              homeroom teacher.
              In homeroom, the teacher takes attendance and informs the students of any announcements. At 1:20 pm the
              students would
              be driven back to the Hostel for lunch. Lunch break lasted 1 hour and 20 minutes. School resumed at 2:40 pm
              and would
              end at 4:00 pm. From 4:00 pm students were free to do extracurricular activities or to stay at school to
              study.
              Meditation was at 6:30 pm, lasted 30 minutes and was followed by dinner. On Saturday, dinner was before
              evening
              meditation because we would have a ‘bhajan night’.
  
  
              <br><br>
  
              As I said, life was very chill and I hope to have given you an insight on the life during the quarantine
              period. Jai Shri Mataji.<br><br>
